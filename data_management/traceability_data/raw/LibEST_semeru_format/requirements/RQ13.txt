Specifying HTTPS as the secure transport for enrollment messages introduces two "layers" to communicate authentication and control messages: TLS and HTTP.

The TLS layer provides integrity and confidentiality during transport. The proof-of-identity is supplied by TLS handshake authentication and optionally also by the HTTP layer headers. The message type and control/error messages are included in the HTTP headers.

CMC ([RFC5272], Section 3.1) notes that "the Simple PKI Request MUST NOT be used if a proof-of-identity needs to be included". Since the TLS and HTTP layers can provide proof-of-identity for EST clients and servers, the Simple PKI message types are used.

The TLS layer certificate exchange provides a method for authorizing client enrollment requests using existing certificates. Such certificates may have been issued by the CA (from which the client is requesting a certificate), or they may have been issued under a distinct PKI (e.g., an IEEE 802.1AR Initial Device Identifier (IDevID) [IDevID] credential).

Proof-of-possession (POP) is a distinct issue from proof-of-identity and is included in the Simple PKI message type as described in Section 3.4. A method of linking proof-of-identity and proof-of-possession is described in Section 3.5.

This document also defines transport for CMC [RFC5272] that complies with the CMC Transport Protocols [RFC5273]. CMC's POP and proof-of-identity mechanisms are defined in CMC, but the mechanisms here can also be used in conjunction with those mechanisms in "Full PKI" messages.

During protocol exchanges, different certificates can be used. The following table provides an informative overview. End-entities can have one or more certificates of each type listed in Figure 3 and use one or more trust anchor databases of each type listed in Figure 4.

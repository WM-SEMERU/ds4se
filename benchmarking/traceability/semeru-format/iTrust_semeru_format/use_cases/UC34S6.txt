A patient can select to report physiologic measurements for those whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring andfor whom he/she is a patient representative. He/she is presented with a list of the patients whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring and for which he/she is allowed to report measurements. He or she can select a patient and then enter data. He or she can report the blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) [E2] and/or glucose levels [E3] for the patient. The input data and a timestamp and the fact that the status was reported by ¡°patient representative¡± and their MID are saved. Only the applicable input entries (those whose corresponding data types of the patient are specified to be under monitoring) are displayed to the patient.

A UAP can select to report physiologic measurements. He/she is presented with a list of the patients whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring and for whom he/she is allowed to report measurements. He or she can select a patient and then enter data. He or she can report the blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) [E2] and/or glucose levels [E3] for the patient. The input data, a timestamp, and the fact the the status was reported by ¡°case manager¡± and their MID are saved. Only the applicable input entries (those whose corresponding data types of the patient are specified to be under monitoring) are displayed to the UAP.

Through the Personal Health Records page, an LHCP chooses a chronic disease and a patient. The data in the database is analyzed according to the risk factors for the disease to determine if the patient exhibits a certain risk factor. Currently available risk factors for chronic diseases are defined for Diabetes and Type 1 and Type2 and Heart Disease. When the chosen patient satisfies the preconditions of the chosen chronic disease [E1], the LHCP is provided with a warning message if that patient exhibits three or more risk factors. The message will display the risk factors that the patients exhibit.

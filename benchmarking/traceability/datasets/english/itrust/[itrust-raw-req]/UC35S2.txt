A patient is presented with a listing of all immunizations for which he/she has been administered in the last 12 months. The patient chooses the immunization for which to report the adverse event. The patient is then able to write a textual description which describes the symptoms of the adverse event and to save the information. A fake email is sent to the LHCP who administered the immunization indicating the patient name and MID, drug, and symptoms.

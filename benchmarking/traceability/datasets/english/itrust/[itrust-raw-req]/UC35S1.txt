A patient is presented with a listing of all prescription drugs for which he/she has been prescribed and/or has taken in the last 12 months. The patient chooses one or more drug(s) for which to report the adverse event. The patient is then able to write a textual description which describes the symptoms of the adverse event and to save the information. A fake email is sent to the LHCP who prescribed the medication indicating the patient name and MID, drug, and symptoms.

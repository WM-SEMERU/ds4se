A public health agent is presented with a listing of immunization-related adverse events for the time period that do not have a status of ¡°removed¡±, sorted by CPT code . The public health agent can select to see the detail of a specific report. Upon reading the report, the public health agent can choose to send a ¡°fake email¡± message to the adverse event reporter to gain more information about the report. The public health agent may also choose to remove an adverse event report (such as based upon communication with the reporter or because the report appears to be bogus) [S3].

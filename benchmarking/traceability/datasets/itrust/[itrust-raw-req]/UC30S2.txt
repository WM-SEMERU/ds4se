An LHCP chooses to send a message to a patient/representative (no multiple recipients allowed in a single message). The LHCP enters and confirms the patient/representative's MID [E1, E2]. The LHCP types the subject (up to 100 characters) and the text of a message (up to 1000 characters), and clicks the send button. A row for showing the message subject, the name of the recipient, and the timestamp is then visible in the LHCP¡¯s message outbox. A bolded row for showing the message subject, the name of the sender, and the timestamp is then visible in the patient/representative¡¯s message inbox, and a fake email is sent to the patient/representative that indicates that he/she has a new message from an LHCP. After a message is sent, the LHCP is directed to to his/her message outbox.

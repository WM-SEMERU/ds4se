A user (a patient, patient representative, or LHCP) can sort messages in his or her message inbox by either the sender's last name or timestamp (but not both) in either ascending or descending order (where timestamps in descending order would have the most recent first). A user can sort messages in his or her message outbox by the recipient's last name or timestamp (but not both) in either ascending or descending order. To do so, a user selects one option out of the ¡°Sort by¡± labeled drop-down box (with options of ¡°Sender/Recipient¡± or ¡°Timestamp¡±) and selects one option out of the ¡°by order of¡± labeled drop-down box (with options of ¡°ascending¡± or ¡°descending¡±), and then click the ¡°Sort¡± button. Note that the sorted order is not saved for later viewing after the message inbox or outbox is reopened again (where the default sorting is always used).

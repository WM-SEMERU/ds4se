A user (an LHCP or patient) wishes to view a list of his or her upcoming appointments (i.e., a list including appointments whose appointment date and start time is equal or later than the current date/time). The user chooses to open his or her upcoming appointment list. Each row in the list includes the appointment type, appointment date and start time, duration, and the name of either the patient (only for the user being an LHCP) or the LHCP (only for the user being a patient). The appointments in the list shall be ordered by appointment date and start time, the soonest upcoming first. The row for each conflicting appointment is highlighted in bold (a conflicting appointment is one that has overlap in its appointment duration period with that of at least another appointment of the same user). When viewing the calendar, the user selects an appointment from the list to read comment by clicking the ¡°Read Comment¡± link beside the row for the appointment, and then the comment for the appointment shall be displayed in a new page [E2].

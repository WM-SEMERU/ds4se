100,Requirements shall be managed in a 3rd party requirements management tool such as DOORS.
101,Non-requirement artifacts shall be managed in 3rd party tools such as Rational Rose or Clear case
102,Only registered subscribers shall be allowed to establish traces.
103,A user shall register as a subscriber.
104,On registration a subscriber shall register itself under the control of a subscribermanager
105,The user shall establish traces between requirements and other types of artifacts by establishing a subscription from an artifact to the relevant requirement
106,Each artifact shall be placed under the control of a subscribermanager
107,The user shall be able to delete subscriptions.
108,A subscribermanager shall register itself with the eventserver so that it may receive relevant event messages.
109,If the subscribermanager is online; the push model shall be used to send it event notifications in real time.
110,Whenever the subscribermanager first comes on line; it shall implement the pull model to retrieve outstanding event messages from the eventserver.
111,A subscribermanager shall receive event notifications on behalf of the artifacts that it manages.
112,A subscribermanager shall manage traces for one or more artifacts.
113,On receipt of an event message; the subscribermanager shall differentiate between speculative and evolutionary events.
114,The subscribermanager shall store information for evolutionary events in an eventlog.
115,The user shall be able to construct speculative queries using a GUI.
116,The subscribermanager shall immediately process speculative events.
117,The subscribermanager shall re execute the model using the speculative values.
118,The subscribermanager shall report results indicating whether the speculative change negatively impacts other requirements and constraints.
119,The subscribermanager shall restore the executable model to its prior state.
120,The prototype system shall utilize a driver to trigger events.
121,Event types shall include adding new requirements.
122,Event types shall include decomposing one requirement into two or more requirements.
123,Event types shall include refining one requirement by adding an additional requirement to the existing one.
124,Event types shall include modifying a requirement.
125,Event types shall include deleting a requirement.
126,Event types shall include merging requirements.
127,The eventserver shall receive event messages when a requirement changes.
128,On receipt of an event message the eventserver shall record the event in an eventlog.
129,On receipt of an event; the eventserver shall identify all relevant subscribers for the event.
130,The eventserver shall differentiate between evolutionary and speculative events.
131,When an evolutionary event occurs; the eventserver shall notify subscribers of the event.
132,For speculative events; the eventserver shall construct a composite event message.
133,The eventserver shall identify all related requirements and constraints for each impacted executable model.
134,The eventserver shall retrieve quantitative values related to these additional requirements and constraints through querying the requirements management tool.
135,The eventserver shall create a composite speculative message which includes the speculative event plus all related requirements and constraint values for each impacted model.
136,The eventserver shall send the customized message to each impacted executable model.
137,The user shall view all evolutionary events received for a specific artifact in the order in which they were received.
138,The user shall update related artifacts according to the information contained in the event messages.
139,The user shall eliminate unnecessary traces that were temporarily constructed by the eventserver during initial event processing.
140,The notification processing system shall automatically eliminate any events that are not longer valid as a result of the user eliminating temporary traces.

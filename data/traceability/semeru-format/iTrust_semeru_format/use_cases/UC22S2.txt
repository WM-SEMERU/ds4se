The LHCP chooses to schedule an appointment with a patient (it is assumed that the LHCP and patient have already worked out the details of the appointment in person or via telephone outside of the system). The LHCP enters the patient MID, selects the type of appointment from a pull-down menu of the existing appointment types, enter the appointment date and start time (only a date/time equal or after the current date/time is allowed) (the user interface shall provide both the option of typing in a specific date in the date format and the option of selecting a date from a calendar for the current month), enter comment (optional) up to 1000 characters such as reason for the appointment [E1].

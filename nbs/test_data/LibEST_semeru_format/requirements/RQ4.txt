REQUIREMENT 4: OBTAINING CA CERTIFICATES
     
The EST client can request a copy of the current EST CA certificate(s) from the EST server. The EST client is assumed to perform this operation before performing other operations.

Throughout this document we assume the EST CA has a certificate that is used by the client to verify signed objects issued by the CA, e.g., certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and that a different certificate than the one used to verify signatures on certificates and CRLs is used when EST protocol communication requires additional encryption.

The EST client authenticates and verifies the authorization scope of the EST server when requesting the current CA certificate(s). As detailed in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.3, available options include:

Verifying the EST server's HTTPS URI against the EST server's certificate using Implicit TAs (similar to a common HTTPS exchange). This allows the EST server and client to leverage existing TAs that might be known to the EST client.
 
The client can leverage a previously distributed trust anchor specific to the EST server. This allows the EST client to use an existing, potentially older, CA certificate to request a current CA certificate.
 
For bootstrapping, the EST client can rely upon manual authentication performed by the end-user as detailed in Section 4.1.1.
 
The client can leverage the binding of a shared credential to a specific EST server with a certificate-less TLS cipher suite.
Client authentication is not required for this exchange, so it is trivially supported by the EST server.

REQUIREMENT 51: SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     
Support for Basic authentication, as specified in HTTP [RFC2617], allows the server access to a client's cleartext password. This provides support for legacy username/password databases but requires exposing the plaintext password to the EST server. Use of a PIN or one-time password can help mitigate such exposure, but it is RECOMMENDED that EST clients use such credentials only once to obtain a client certificate (that will be used during future interactions with the EST server).

When a client uses the Implicit TA database for certificate validation (see Section 3), then authorization proceeds as specified in Section 3.6.2. In this situation, the client has validated the server as being a responder that is certified by a third party for the URI configured, but it cannot verify that the responder is authorized to act as an RA for the PKI in which the client is trying to enroll. Clients using an Implicit Trust Anchor database are RECOMMENDED to use only TLS-based client authentication (to prevent exposing HTTP-based client authentication information). It is RECOMMENDED that such clients include "Linking Identity and POP Information" (Section 3.5) in requests (to prevent such requests from being forwarded to a real EST server by a man in the middle). It is RECOMMENDED that the Implicit Trust Anchor database used for EST server authentication be carefully managed to reduce the chance of a third-party CA with poor certification practices from being trusted. Disabling the Implicit Trust Anchor database after successfully receiving the Distribution of CA certificates response (Section 4.1.3) limits any vulnerability to the first TLS exchange.

Certificate-less TLS cipher suites that maintain security and perform the mutual authentication necessary for enrollment have the following properties:

the only information leaked by an active attack is whether or not a single guess of the secret is correct.
 
any advantage an adversary gains is through interaction and not computation.
 
it is possible to perform countermeasures, such as exponential backoff after a certain number of failed attempts, to frustrate repeated active attacks.
Using a certificate-less cipher suite that does not have the properties listed above would render the results of enrollment void and potentially result in certificates being issued to unauthenticated and/or unauthorized entities.

When using a certificate-less TLS cipher suite, the shared secret used for authentication and authorization cannot be shared with an entity that is not a party to the exchange: someone other than the client and the server. Any additional sharing of secrets voids the security afforded by a certificate-less cipher suite. Exposure of a shared secret used by a certificate-less cipher suite to a third party enables client impersonation that can result in corruption of a client's trust anchor database.

TLS cipher suites that include "_EXPORT_" and "_DES_" in their names MUST NOT be used. These ciphers do not offer a sufficient level of protection; 40-bit crypto in 2013 doesn't offer acceptable protection, and the use of DES is deprecated.

As described in CMC, Section 6.7 of [RFC5272], "For keys that can be used as signature keys, signing the certification request with the private key serves as a POP on that key pair". The inclusion of tls- unique within the certification request links the proof-of-possession to the TLS proof-of-identity by enforcing that the POP operation occurred while the TLS session was active. This implies to the server that the authenticated client currently has access to the private key. If the authenticated client is known to have specific capabilities, such as hardware protection for authentication credentials and key storage, this implication is strengthened but not proven.

The server-side key generation method allows keys to be transported over the TLS connection to the client without any application-layer protection. The distribution of private key material is inherently risky. Private key distribution uses the encryption mode of the negotiated TLS cipher suite. Keys are not protected by preferred key wrapping methods such as AES Key Wrap [RFC3394] or as specified in [RFC5958] as encryption of the private key beyond that provided by TLS is optional. It is RECOMMENDED that EST servers not support this operation by default. It is RECOMMENDED that clients not request this service unless there is a compelling operational benefit. Use of an Implicit Trust Anchor database is NOT RECOMMENDED when server-side key generation is employed. The use of an encrypted CMS Server-Side Key Generation Response is RECOMMENDED.

Regarding the CSR attributes that the CA may list for inclusion in an enrollment request, there are no real inherent security issues with the content being conveyed, but an adversary who is able to interpose herself into the conversation could exclude attributes that a server may want, include attributes that a server may not want, and render meaningless other attributes that a server may want.

ASN.1 encoding rules (e.g., DER and BER) have a type-length-value structure, and it is easy to construct malicious content with invalid length fields that can cause buffer overrun conditions. ASN.1 encoding rules allow for arbitrary levels of nesting, which may make it possible to construct malicious content that will cause a stack overflow. Interpreters of ASN.1 structures should be aware of these issues and should take appropriate measures to guard against buffer overflows and stack overruns in particular, and malicious content in general.

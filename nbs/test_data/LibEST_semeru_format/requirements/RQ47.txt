REQUIREMENT 47: CSR ATTRIBUTES
     
CA policy may allow inclusion of client-provided attributes in certificates that it issues, and some of these attributes may describe information that is not available to the CA. In addition, a CA may desire to certify a certain type of public key and a client may not have a priori knowledge of that fact. Therefore, clients SHOULD request a list of expected attributes that are required, or desired, by the CA in an enrollment request or if dictated by local policy.

The EST server SHOULD NOT require client authentication or authorization to reply to this request.

Requesting CSR attributes is optional, but clients are advised that CAs may refuse enrollment requests that are not encoded according to the CA's policy.

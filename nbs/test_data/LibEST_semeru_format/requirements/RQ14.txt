REQUIREMENT 14: APPLICATION LAYER
     
The EST client MUST be capable of generating and parsing Simple PKI messages (see Section 4.2). Generating and parsing Full PKI messages is OPTIONAL (see Section 4.3). The client MUST also be able to request CA certificates from the EST server and parse the returned "bag" of certificates (see Section 4.1). Requesting CSR attributes and parsing the returned list of attributes is OPTIONAL (see Section 4.5).

Details of the EST client application configuration are out of scope of the protocol discussion but are necessary for understanding the prerequisites of initiating protocol operations. The EST client is RECOMMENDED to be configured with TA databases for Section 3.3.1 or with a secret key for Section 3.3.3. Implementations conforming to this standard MUST provide the ability to designate Explicit TAs. For human usability reasons, a "fingerprint" of an Explicit TA database entry can be configured for bootstrapping as discussed in Section 4.1.1. Configuration of an Implicit TA database, perhaps by its inclusion within the EST client distribution or available from the operating system, provides flexibility along with the caveats detailed in Section 6. Implementations conforming to this standard MUST provide the ability to disable use of any Implicit TA database.

The EST client is configured with sufficient information to form the EST server URI. This can be the full operation path segment (e.g., https://www.example.com/.well-known/est/ or https://www.example.com/.well-known/est/arbitraryLabel1), or the EST client can be configured with a tuple composed of the authority portion of the URI along with the OPTIONAL label (e.g., "www.example.com:80" and "arbitraryLabel1") or just the authority portion of the URI.

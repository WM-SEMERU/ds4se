REQUIREMENT 38: SIMPLE ENROLL AND RE-ENROLL RESPONSE
     
If the enrollment is successful, the server response MUST contain an HTTP 200 response code with a content-type of "application/pkcs7-mime".

A successful response MUST be a certs-only CMC Simple PKI Response, as defined in [RFC5272], containing only the certificate that was issued. The HTTP content-type of "application/pkcs7-mime" with an smime-type parameter "certs-only" is used, as specified in [RFC5273].

The server MUST answer with a suitable 4xx or 5xx HTTP [RFC2616] error code when a problem occurs. A Simple PKI Response with an HTTP content-type of "application/pkcs7-mime" (see Section 4.3.2) MAY be included in the response data to convey an error response. If the content-type is not set, the response data MUST be a plaintext human- readable error message containing explanatory information describing why the request was rejected (for example, indicating that CSR attributes are incomplete).

If the server responds with an HTTP [RFC2616] 202, this indicates that the request has been accepted for processing but that a response is not yet available. The server MUST include a Retry-After header as defined for HTTP 503 responses. The server also MAY include informative human-readable content. The client MUST wait at least the specified "retry-after" time before repeating the same request. The client repeats the initial enrollment request after the appropriate "retry-after" interval has expired. The client SHOULD log or inform the end-user of this event. The server is responsible for maintaining all states necessary to recognize and handle retry operations as the client is stateless in this regard; it simply sends the same request repeatedly until it receives a different response code. All other return codes are handled as specified in HTTP [RFC2616].

If the client closes the TLS connections while waiting for the Retry- After time to expire, then the client initiates a new TLS connection and performs all applicable security checks. If the client has already generated a CSR that includes linking identity and POP information (Section 3.5), then the CSR will need to be recreated to incorporate the tls-unique from the new, redirected session. Note: the key pair need not be regenerated. These are processing and interface burdens on the client. EST server administrators are advised to take this into consideration.

The EST client MAY also make the certificate response, and associated private key, available to end-entity software for use as an end-entity certificate.

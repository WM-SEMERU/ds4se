REQUIREMENT 33: CA CERTIFICATES REQUEST
     
EST clients request the EST CA TA database information of the CA (in the form of certificates) with an HTTPS GET message using an operation path of "/cacerts". EST clients and servers MUST support the /cacerts function. Clients SHOULD request an up-to-date response before stored information has expired in order to ensure the EST CA TA database is up to date.

The EST server SHOULD NOT require client authentication or authorization to reply to this request.

The client MUST authenticate the EST server, as specified in Section 3.3.1 if certificate-based authentication is used or Section 3.3.3 if the optional certificate-less authentication is used, and check the server's authorization as given in Section 3.6, or follow the procedure outlined in Section 4.1.1.

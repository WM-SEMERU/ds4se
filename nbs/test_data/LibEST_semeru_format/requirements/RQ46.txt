REQUIREMENT 46: SERVER-SIDE KEY GENERATION RESPONSE
     
If the request is successful, the server response MUST have an HTTP 200 response code with a content-type of "multipart/mixed" consisting of two parts: one part is the private key data and the other part is the certificate data.

The format in which the private key data part is returned is dependent on whether the private key is being returned with additional encryption on top of that provided by TLS.

If additional encryption is not being employed, the private key data MUST be placed in an "application/pkcs8". An "application/pkcs8" part consists of the base64-encoded DER-encoded [X.690] PrivateKeyInfo with a Content-Transfer-Encoding of "base64" [RFC2045].

If additional encryption is being employed, the private key is placed inside of a CMS SignedData. The SignedData is signed by the party that generated the private key, which may or may not be the EST server or the EST CA. The SignedData is further protected by placing it inside of a CMS EnvelopedData, as described in Section 4 of [RFC5958]. The following list shows how the EncryptedData is used, depending on the type of protection key specified by the client.

If the client specified a symmetric encryption key to protect the server-generated private key, the EnvelopedData content is encrypted using the secret key identified in the request. The EnvelopedData RecipientInfo field MUST indicate the key-encryption kekri key management technique. The values are as follows: version is set to 4, key-encryption key identifier (kekid) is set to the value of the DecryptKeyIdentifier from Section 4.4.1.1; keyEncryptionAlgorithm is set to one of the key wrap algorithms that the client included in the SMIMECapabilities accompanying the request; and encryptedKey is the encrypted key.
 
If the client specified an asymmetric encryption key suitable for key transport operations to protect the server-generated private key, the EnvelopedData content is encrypted using a randomly generated symmetric encryption key. The cryptographic strength of the symmetric encryption key SHOULD be equivalent to the client- specified asymmetric key. The EnvelopedData RecipientInfo field MUST indicate the KeyTransRecipientInfo (ktri) key management technique. In KeyTransRecipientInfo, the RecipientIdentifier (rid) is either the subjectKeyIdentifier copied from the attribute defined in Section 4.4.1.2 or the server determines an associated issuerAndSerialNumber from the attribute; version is derived from the choice of rid [RFC5652], keyEncryptionAlgorithm is set to one of the key wrap algorithms that the client included in the SMIMECapabilities accompanying the request, and encryptedKey is the encrypted key.
 
If the client specified an asymmetric encryption key suitable for key agreement operations to protect the server-generated private key, the EnvelopedData content is encrypted using a randomly generated symmetric encryption key. The cryptographic strength of the symmetric encryption key SHOULD be equivalent to the client- specified asymmetric key. The EnvelopedData RecipientInfo field MUST indicate the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo (kari) key management technique. In the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo type, version, originator, and user keying material (ukm) are as in [RFC5652], and keyEncryptionAlgorithm is set to one of the key wrap algorithms that the client included in the SMIMECapabilities accompanying the request. The recipient's key identifier is either copied from the attribute defined in Section 4.4.1.2 to subjectKeyIdentifier or the server determines an IssuerAndSerialNumber that corresponds to the value provided in the attribute.
In all three additional encryption cases, the EnvelopedData is returned in the response as an "application/pkcs7-mime" part with an smime-type parameter of "server-generated-key" and a Content- Transfer-Encoding of "base64".

The certificate data part is an "application/pkcs7-mime" and exactly matches the certificate response to /simpleenroll.

When rejecting a request, the server MUST specify either an HTTP 4xx error or an HTTP 5xx error. If the content-type is not set, the response data MUST be a plaintext human-readable error message.

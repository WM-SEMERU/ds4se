REQUIREMENT 21: TLS-BASED SERVER AUTHENTICATION
     
TLS server authentication with certificates MUST be supported.

The EST client authenticates the EST server as defined for the cipher suite negotiated. The following text provides details assuming a certificate-based cipher suite, such as the TLS 1.1 [RFC4346] mandatory cipher suite (TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA).

Certificate validation MUST be performed as per [RFC5280]. The EST server certificate MUST conform to the [RFC5280] certificate profile.

The client validates the TLS server certificate using the EST client Explicit and, if enabled, Implicit TA database(s). The client MUST maintain a distinction between the use of Explicit and Implicit TA databases during authentication in order to support proper authorization. The EST client MUST perform authorization checks as specified in Section 3.6.

If certificate validation fails, the client MAY follow the procedure outlined in Section 4.1.1 for Bootstrap Distribution of CA certificates.
